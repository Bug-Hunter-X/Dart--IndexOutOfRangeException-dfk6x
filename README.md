# Dart IndexOutOfRangeException Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfRangeException`.  The `bug.dart` file shows code that attempts to access an element in a list using an invalid index. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.dart`

This is a common error when working with lists or arrays, and it's important to check your array bounds before performing index-based access operations.
